group Request
	User -> CDA : get Entity Room1 (Header: Forward-To: provider-ecc)
	note left
		1. Header value 
		**Forward-To: ecc-providr.com**
		is mandatory so that Consumer Connector 
		knows location of B-endoint for Provider Connector.
		Request will contain URL of Provider Context Broker, so 
		that Provider Data App knows where to forward request
		2. Header value: 
		**Provider-Context-Broker: provider.context.broker.com/** 
		is mandatory so that Provider DataApp knows which provider CB
		should sned request to.
	end note

	CECC -> PECC : forward request using Forward-To value
	PECC -> PDA : forward
	PDA -> PCB : recreate URL and send request from payload
