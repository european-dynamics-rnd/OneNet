		1. Header value:
		**Forward-To: ecc-providr.com**
		is mandatory so that Consumer Connector 
		knows location of B-endoint for Provider Connector.
		Request will contain URL of Provider Context Broker, so 
		that Provider Data App knows where to forward request
		2. Header value: 
		**Provider-Context-Broker: provider.context.broker.com/** 
		is mandatory so that Provider DataApp knows which provider CB
		should sned request to.
		3. Header value:
		**Sender-ECC: ecc-consumer.com**
		Need this value in order to know Forward-To URL when
		notification event is received
	end note
	CDA -> CDA : create subscription request\npack **Provider-Context-Broker** to payload
	CDA -> CECC : send request to Provider ECC\nusing Forward-To URL
	CECC -> PECC : forward 
	PECC -> PDA : forward
	note right 
		"Create Binding"
		1. Replace URL in subscription request with Provider Data App URL
		2. Store original URL of subscription request - it will be needed to send back,
		so that Consumer Data App knows to which Context Broker to send data
		3. Make binding of EntityId in subscription request, original URL
		4. Missing information of Consumer ECC (Forward-To when notification is received)
		Need to use custom header **Sender-ECC**
	end note
	PDA -> PCB : /v2/subscriptions fire request with dataApp URL 
	PCB -> PCB : create new subscription
	PCB -> PDA : send subscription created response
	PDA -> PDA : process response from PCB - subscriptionId
	note right: save "subscriptionId": "57458eb60962ef754e7c0998" and create mapping with originating URL
